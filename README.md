# Baklava (toy project) - üçÆ

A small project to do some face checking in Rust by using the [InsightFace SDK](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface). It uses a fork of InsightFace in order to implement some convenient method to be exposed for Rust that can be found [here](https://github.com/shigedangao/insightface). The implementation is based on the sample provided by the insightface team. [c example link](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/blob/master/cpp-package/inspireface/cpp/sample/api/sample_face_comparison.c)

## Usage

In order to use the library you'll need to specify the model that will be used. These models are the same that are used by the InsightFace library. The models can be found [here](https://github.com/HyperInspire/InspireFace?tab=readme-ov-file#resource-package-list)

```rs
let (cosine, percentage) = InsightFace::new("<model>", None)?
    .prepare_images(&[
        "./face1.png",
        "./face2.png",
    ])?
    .prepare_target_image("./face3.png")?
    .compare_images(Methodology::Mean)?;
```

## Install

1. Clone & Initialize submodules

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/shigedangao/baklava.git

# or

git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Initialize insightface submodules dependencies

```sh
cd insightface/cpp-package/inspireface && git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tunmx/inspireface-3rdparty.git 3rdparty
```

3. Build the project

```sh
cargo build
```

## Recompile insightface

If you wish to recompile the InsightFace - `rm -rf ./insightface/cpp-package/inspireface/build`

## Run

```sh
cargo run --example compare
```

If cargo run fail then you can try to specify the `DYLIB_INCLUDE_PATH` variable like below

```sh
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=./insightface/cpp-package/inspireface/build/inspire-{arch}/InspireFace/lib cargo run --example compare
```
