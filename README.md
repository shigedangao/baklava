# Baklava (toy project) - üçÆ

A small project to do some face checking in Rust by using the [InsightFace SDK](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface). It uses a fork of InsightFace in order to implement some convenient method to be exposed for Rust that can be found [here](https://github.com/shigedangao/insightface). The implementation is based on the sample provided by the insightface team.
